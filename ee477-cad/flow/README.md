IC Design Flow
==============

Makefiles and Scripts for IC Design

---

Scripts for Synopsys tools are primarily from [Solvnet Reference Methodology](https://solvnet.synopsys.com/rmgen).

Reference Methodology contains basic usage flows for Design Compiler (./dc), IC
Compiler (./icc), Milkyway (./mw), and PrimeTime (./pt). Scripts folders having
Reference Methodology use "rm\_" as prefix.

VCS (./vcs), PrimeRail (./pr), and IP generation (./ip) scripts are developed
by UCSD.
