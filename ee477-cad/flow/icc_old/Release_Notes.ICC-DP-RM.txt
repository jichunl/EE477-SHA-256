G-2012.06 and G-2012.06-SP4 
===========================

This release of the IC Compiler Design Planning Reference Methodology does not 
include any product-specific changes. However, it does provide support for the 
enhancements in the Lynx-compatible reference methodology flow. For information 
about these enhancements, see the file named Release_Notes.LynxCompatible-RM.txt.


F-2011.09-SP4
=============

This section describes new features, changes, and enhancements in the
IC Compiler Design Planning Reference Methodology version F-2011.09-SP4.

*  In baseline.tcl, the write_floorplan command options used to write out  
   a floorplan file that the Design Compiler topographical technology can read 
   have been updated:

   write_floorplan -create_terminal -create_bound -row -track -preroute \
       -placement {io terminal hard_macro soft_macro} ${block}.DCT.fp

   The -track option and the terminal argument have been added.


F-2011.09-SP2
=============

This section describes new features, changes, and enhancements in the 
IC Compiler Design Planning Reference Methodology version F-2011.09-SP2.

*  The power network synthesis flow has been updated for baseline.tcl.

   The classic power network synthesis content has been replaced with template-based 
   power network synthesis content in baseline.tcl. To proceed, you must specify a 
   valid customized script using the $CUSTOM_ICC_DP_PNS_SCRIPT variable. 
   For more details, see the descriptions and examples in the template-based power 
   network synthesis section.

This release also provides enhancements in the Lynx-compatible reference methodology 
flow. For information about these enhancements, see the file named 
Release_Notes.LynxCompatible-RM.txt.

E-2010.12
=========

This section describes new features, changes, and enhancements in the IC Compiler 
Design Planning Reference Methodology version E-2010.12.

*  For the overall flat design planning flow, the "route_zrt_global -effort minimum" 
   command has been replaced by the "route_zrt_global -exploration true" command 
   in baseline.tcl and proc_explore.tcl.

*  The $ICC_DP_USE_ZROUTE control variable has been added in baseline.tcl.

   This variable allows you to switch between Zroute and the classic router:

      if {$ICC_DP_USE_ZROUTE} {
          route_zrt_global -exploration true
      } else {
          route_fp_proto -effort medium
      }

This release also provides enhancements in the Lynx-Compatible reference 
methodology flow. For information about these enhancements, see the file 
named Release_Notes.LynxCompatible-RM.txt.


D-2010.03-SP4
=============

This section describes new features, changes, and enhancements in the IC Compiler 
Design Planning Reference Methodology version D-2010.03-SP4.

*  In baseline.tcl, the following comments have been removed because they are 
   obsolete:

   # set_fp_placement_strategy \ 
   #   -voltage_area_interface_net_weight 
   # set_fp_placement_strategy -voltage_area_net_weight_LS_only on

   These comments have been replaced with the following comment:

   # set_fp_placement_strategy -honor_mv_cells on

   The variable $ICC_DP_PLACEMENT_VA_NET_WEIGHT has been removed from icc_setup.tcl.

*  In macro_placement_exploration_dp.tcl and proc_explore.tcl, support for the 
   following controls has been removed:

   S VA interface net wt
   T VA net weight level shifter


D-2010.03-SP3
=============

This section describes new features, changes, and enhancements in the IC Compiler 
Design Planning Reference Methodology version D-2010.03-SP3.

*  In proc_explore.tcl, the route_zrt_global effort level has been updated from 
   low to minimum when ICC_DP_USE_ZROUTE is set to TRUE.

*  In baseline.tcl,

   o  The create_qor_snapshot command has been updated to resolve Synopsys Technical
      Action Request (STAR) number 9000403233, "create_qor_snapshot not updated in 
      baseline.tcl."

   o  Support for $CUSTOM_ICC_DP_PNS_SCRIPT has been added in the power network 
      synthesis (PNS) section.

=============

This section describes new features, changes, and enhancements in the IC Compiler 
Design Planning Reference Methodology version D-2010.03-SP2.

*  Multicore support has been added for explore mode by replacing the 
   "-num_cpus $vfp_num_cpus" command in proc_explore.tcl with the 
   "set_host_options -max_cores $ICC_NUM_CORES" command. 


D-2010.03-SP1
=============

This section describes new features, changes, and enhancements in the IC Compiler 
Design Planning Reference Methodology version D-2010.03-SP1.

Note: 
   The D-2010.03-SP1 IC Compiler Design Planning Reference Methodology is 
   compatible with the IC Compiler version D-2010.03-SP1-1.

The following files have been renamed:

*  feasibility_dp.tcl has been renamed flat_dp.tcl.

*  explore.tcl has been renamed macro_placement_exploration_dp.tcl.

All the scripts and makefiles have been updated.


D-2010.03
=========

This section describes new features, changes, and enhancements in the IC Compiler 
Design Planning Reference Methodology version D-2010.03.

*  This release introduces Lynx-compatible versions of the reference methodology 
   scripts, which you can select in RMgen on SolvNet.
   
   For more information about the Lynx-compatible reference methodology scripts, 
   see SolvNet article number 029774 at 
   https://solvnet.synopsys.com/retrieve/029774.html.

*  The reference methodology directory structure has been reorganized for all 
   versions of the product reference methodologies.
   
   o  The setup files and makefiles have been moved to a new directory named 
      rm_setup.
   
   o  The scripts directory has been renamed rm_<prod>_scripts, where <prod> is 
      the product identifier: dc, icc, pt, or tmax.
   
   These changes are the same for every product reference methodology and apply 
   to both the standard and Lynx-compatible versions of the reference methodology 
   scripts. 
   
   The working directory structure depends on whether you are using standard 
   reference methodology scripts or Lynx-compatible reference methodology scripts.

   Due to the directory structure change, the procedure for running the reference 
   methodology scripts has changed from previous releases. For example, to run the 
   IC Compiler Design Planning Reference methodology scripts, enter

   % make -f rm_setup/Makefile dp  

   See README.ICC-DP-RM.txt if you need more details.

*  The explore.tcl script and related supplementary scripts have been updated to 
   use the new create_qor_snapshot command behavior.

*  The variable ICC_DP_USE_ZROUTE is now set to TRUE by default.

*  A new variable, REPORTS_DIR_DP, has been added for a step-specific design 
   planning reporting directory.

   If you want to have a specific report directory for the design planning step, 
   use REPORTS_DIR_DP instead of the REPORTS_DIR variable. By default, the tool 
   writes all the reports to REPORTS_DIR and there is no impact on existing usage.

   The icc_setup.tcl file and all scripts have been updated.
