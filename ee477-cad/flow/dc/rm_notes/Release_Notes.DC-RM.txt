G-2012.06-SP4
=============

The following sections describe new features, changes, and enhancements in the
Design Compiler Reference Methodology version G-2012.06-SP4.

General Updates
---------------

*  Support has been added for Design Compiler block abstractions.

*  The recommended -macro option for the IC Compiler write_def command, used
   to create the Design Exchange Format (DEF) file, has been replaced with the
   -fixed option to pass floorplan information with fixed standard cells back
   to Design Compiler.

*  The set_port_location command has been replaced with the create_terminal
   command to include port locations in the floorplan information.

*  Support has been added for shared codec I/O pins with on-chip clocking in
   DFTMAX.

Changes in dc_setup_filenames.tcl
---------------------------------

The tool command language (Tcl) procedures dcrm_compile_ultra_tio_filename and
dcrm_mapped_tio_filename are now included to control the naming of updated
Design Compiler block abstractions after transparent interface optimization.

Changes in dc_setup.tcl
-----------------------

*  The DC_BLOCK_ABSTRACTION_DESIGNS variable has been defined to list the
   Design Compiler block abstraction hierarchical designs without transparent
   interface optimization.

*  The DC_BLOCK_ABSTRACTION_DESIGNS_TIO variable has been defined to list the
   Design Compiler block abstraction hierarchical designs with transparent
   interface Optimization.

*  Conditional checks have been added to avoid incorrect settings because
   block abstractions and interface logic models (ILMs) are not supported in the
   same session.

Common Changes in dc(_top).tcl
------------------------------

*  In the write_def command, the -macro option has been replaced with the
   -fixed option.

*  Updated Design Compiler blocks are now saved after the first compile.

*  The set_port_location command has been replaced with the create_terminal
   command to include port locations in the floorplan information.

Unique Changes in dc.tcl
------------------------

The create_block_abstraction command is now included to support Design
Compiler
block abstractions.

Unique Changes in dc_top.tcl
----------------------------

*  The set_top_implementation_options command has been added to specify
   the blocks that should be read as block abstractions, based on the
   ${DC_BLOCK_ABSTRACTION_DESIGNS} and ${DC_BLOCK_ABSTRACTION_DESIGNS_TIO}
   variables.

*  The check_block_abstraction command has been added to check for design
   errors.

*  Updated Design Compiler blocks with transparent interface optimization
   are now saved in Synopsys logical database format (.ddc).

Lynx Compatibility
------------------

This release provides enhancements in the Lynx-compatible reference
methodology flow. For information about these enhancements, see the
file named Release_Notes.LynxCompatible-RM.txt.


G-2012.06
=========

The following sections describe new features, changes, and enhancements in the
Design Compiler Reference Methodology version G-2012.06.

General Updates
---------------

*  The hierarchical flow now supports physical guidance.

*  Support has been added for IC Compiler block abstractions.

*  Scan compression is now enabled by default when you include a DFT flow.

*  Design Compiler and the reference methodology scripts now create supply set
   handles by default.

   The primary, default isolation, and default retention supply set handles are
   created when the power domains are created.

*  A comment about how to access Visual UPF in Design Vision has been added.

   You can use Visual UPF to generate an IEEE 1801 template for your design.
   IEEE 1801 is also known as Unified Power Format (UPF).

*  The dc.upf file has been updated to include the following examples:

   o  Example 1: UPF using supply set handles and supply sets
   o  Example 2: UPF using domain-dependent supply nets


Changes in dc_setup_filenames.tcl
---------------------------------

*  The DCRM_DCT_SPG_PLACEMENT_OUTPUT_FILE definition has been included, as a
   comment, to enable the standard cell placement output in the physical
   guidance flow.

*  The DCRM_FINAL_SELF_GATING_REPORT variable specifies the name of the report file
   for the XOR self-gating results.

*  The DCRM_DFT_DRC_CONFIGURED_SUMMARY_REPORT variable has been removed.

   Only verbose reports are saved. Summary reports for dft_drc are included
   in the Design Compiler execution.


Changes in dc_setup.tcl
-----------------------

*  The ICC_BLOCK_ABSTRACTION_DESIGNS variable has been defined to list IC Compiler
   block abstraction hierarchical design names.

*  A comment has been added to set upf_create_implicit_supply_sets to false when
   your UPF specification has domain-dependent supply nets.

   By default, the tool creates supply set handles.


Common Changes in dc(_top).tcl
------------------------------

*  The -congestion option for the compile_ultra command has been removed from
   the flow.

   You can use physical guidance instead.

*  The physical guidance flow now supports ASCII output of the standard cell
   placement information for input to the IC Compiler Reference Methodology.

   This capability requires an extra Design Compiler Graphical license or an
   IC Compiler Design Planning license. To enable the file creation, uncomment
   the DCRM_DCT_SPG_PLACEMENT_OUTPUT_FILE variable definition in
   dc_setup_filenme.tcl.

*  You can now use ${DCRM_SDC_INPUT_FILE}, ${DCRM_CONSTRAINTS_INPUT_FILE}, or both
   to constrain the design. The tool reads both files if they exist.

*  Ports being created during insert_dft are added to path groups to improve
   optimization results.

*  Information about how to use enable XOR self-gating has been added to the script.

*  Information and an example that show how to create timing constraints for
   serialized compressed scan have been added to the script.

Unique Changes in dc_top.tcl
----------------------------

*  The set_top_implementation_options command has been added to specify
   the blocks that should be read as block abstractions, based on the
   ${ICC_BLOCK_ABSTRACTION_DESIGNS} variable.

*  Reports have been added for block abstraction settings and usage.

*  Core Test Language (CTL) test models for IC Compiler block abstractions are now
   read in to ensure that the design-for-test (DFT) information is present.

*  Information about how to use Shared Codec I/O pins in DFTMAX has been
   included in the script.


Common Changes in fm(_top).tcl
------------------------------

Information has been added about how the automated setup mode, with the verification
setup file, automatically sets the hdlin_dwroot variable to the top level of the
Design Compiler tree used for synthesis.


Lynx Compatibility
------------------

This release provides enhancements in the Lynx-compatible reference methodology
flow. For information about these enhancements, see the file named
Release_Notes.LynxCompatible-RM.txt.


F-2011.09-SP4
=============

The following sections describe new features, changes, and enhancements in the
Design Compiler Reference Methodology version F-2011.09-SP4.

Common Changes in dc(_top).tcl
------------------------------

*  A comment has been added about using the set_congestion_optimization command
   to control congestion optimization when using the -congestion option with
   the compile_ultra command.

*  Information and support has been added for the secondary floorplan file
   written by Design Compiler. This file allows you to recreate physical-only
   objects in the design prior to reading in the main floorplan file.


Lynx Compatibility
------------------

This release provides enhancements in the Lynx-compatible reference methodology
flow that were added for the F-2011.09-SP2 release, in which the Design Compiler
Reference Methodology did not participate. For information about these enhancements,
see the file named Release_Notes.LynxCompatible-RM.txt.


F-2011.09
=========

General Updates
---------------

*  IC Compiler interface logic model (ILM) support has been added for the
   hierarchical multivoltage flow.

*  User interface changes have been made for leakage and dynamic power optimization.

*  A new option, Pin-Limited Compression, has been added to the RMgen interface
   on SolvNet.

   Set this option to TRUE to insert serialized compressed scan, which is
   recommended to improve the ATPG quality of results (QoR) for designs or
   blocks with a limited number of top-level scan ports.

*  Information has been added about forcing IEEE 1801 supplies for Formality
   verification in UPF flows.

   IEEE 1801 is also known as Unified Power Format (UPF).


Lynx Compatibility
-------------------

This release provides enhancements in the Lynx-compatible reference
methodology flow. For information about these enhancements, see the
file named Release_Notes.LynxCompatible-RM.txt.


Changes in dc_setup.tcl
-----------------------

*  You can now specify the list of IC Compiler ILMs when using a hierarchical
   multivoltage flow.

*  You no longer need to add IC Compiler ILMs to the link_library variable.
   The tool automatically finds IC Compiler ILMs that are included in the list
   of Milkyway reference libraries defined in common_setup.tcl.


Common Changes in dc(_top).tcl
------------------------------

*  Reference methodology generated error and warning messages now have the
   following prefixes: RM-Error and RM-Warning.

*  The -type option has been added to the set_multi_vth_constraint command used
   to limit the number of low-threshold-voltage cells in the design.

*  The commands used to enable leakage power optimization and dynamic power
   optimization have been changed:

   o  set_leakage_optimization true
   o  set_dynamic_optimization true

*  For a multicorner-multimode flow, dynamic power optimization is now scenario
   independent and you can enable it in the main Design Compiler script.

*  The write_environment -consistency command in the multicorner-multimode flow now
   uses the correct tool command language (Tcl) procedure name, dcrm_mcmm_filename,
   instead of the incorrect name mcmm_file.

*  Support has been added for pin-limited scan compression.

   Set the new Pin-Limited Compression option to TRUE if you want RMgen to generate
   scripts that include serialized compressed scan insertion in a DFT flow with
   adaptive scan.


Unique changes in dc_top.tcl
----------------------------

The hierarchical multivoltage flow now includes scripting that supports IC Compiler
ILMs in the flow.


Changes in dc.mcmm.scenarios.tcl
--------------------------------

* The set_scenario_options command no longer includes the -dynamic_power option.

* The set_max_leakage_power command has been removed from the leakage scenario.

  You should use only the set_scenario_options command to define the type of
  scenario for optimization purposes.


Common Changes in fm(_top).tcl
------------------------------

Information has been added about the verification_force_upf_supplies_on variable.

*  The default value of this variable has been changed to true in Formality
   version F-2011.09.

*  Set this variable to false if you want to revert back to the previous
   verification behavior for UPF supplies.


E-2010.12-SP4
=============

General Updates
---------------

Information has been added about handling inconclusive and hard verifications
in the Formality verification setup section.


Common Changes in dc(_top).tcl
------------------------------

The setup for the Formality Verification section has been enhanced with
information about handling inconclusive and hard verifications.


Lynx Compatibility
-------------------

This release provides enhancements in the Lynx-Compatible reference
methodology flow. For information about these enhancements, see the
file named Release_Notes.LynxCompatible-RM.txt.


E-2010.12-SP2
=============

General Updates
---------------

*  The multicorner-multimode flow has been added to the Design Compiler Reference
   Methodology in this release.

   You can now generate multicorner-multimode versions of the scripts for all the
   supported flows.

   o  A new option, named MCMM Flow, has been added to the RMgen interface on
      SolvNet.

      Set this option to TRUE if you want RMgen to generate scripts for a
      multicorner-multimode flow in Design Compiler.

   o  A new file, rm_dc_scripts/dc.mcmm.scenarios.tcl, has been added to provide an
      example of a setup file for multicorner-multimode scenarios in Design Compiler.

*  Physical guidance to IC Compiler is now supported in top-down IEEE 1801 flow.

   IEEE 1801 is also known as Unified Power Format (UPF).

   You can generate multivoltage UPF flow scripts that include physical guidance
   to IC Compiler.

*  The RM-Info messages have been enhanced to print out the full paths of the
   input files.

   This improves debugging by providing the full path of each file that is
   read into the script.

   In previous versions, only the file names were printed out.

*  The MVRC Static Verification Reference Methodology scripts have been enhanced to
   support tool enhancements in MVRC version E-2011.03.

   The release notes for the MVRC Static Verification Reference Methodology scripts
   are now provided in a separate file, named Release_Notes.MVRC-RM.txt


Lynx Compatibility
-------------------

This release provides enhancements in the Lynx-Compatible reference
methodology flow. For information about these enhancements, see the
file named Release_Notes.LynxCompatible-RM.txt.


Changes in dc_setup_filenames.tcl
---------------------------------

*  RMgen adds a new MCMM Filenames section to the scripts when you generate them
   with the MCMM Flow option set to TRUE.

   The MCMM Filenames section contains the following information:

   o  DCRM_MCMM_SCENARIOS_SETUP_FILE specifies the name of the file that defines
      the multicorner-multimode scenarios for the design.

   o  DCRM_MCMM_SCENARIOS_REPORT specifies the name of the report file for the
      report_scenarios command output.

   o  dcrm_mcmm_filenames is a tool command language (Tcl) procedure that defines
      how the scenario name should be added to a non-multicorner-multimode file name
      for a multicorner-multimode flow.

      The scripts use this procedure for all input and output files that are
      scenario specific in an multicorner-multimode flow.

*  DCRM_CHECK_LIBRARY_REPORT has been added to point to the output from the
   check_library command, which runs in the dc_setup.tcl script.


Changes in dc_setup.tcl
-----------------------

*  For a multivoltage flow, the synopsys_program_name string has been changed
   from "mvrc_shell" to "mvrc".

   In MVRC version E-2011.03, synopsys_program_name is defined in the
   tool with a value of "mvrc".

*  For a multivoltage flow, the search_path variable settings in the dc_setup.tcl
   script are also used by the MVRC scripts.

   MVRC version E-2011.03 allows multiple definitions of the search_path variable.
   In previous versions of MVRC, search_path could be defined only once.

*  For a multivoltage flow, the link_library variable settings for MVRC are now
   defined in the dc_setup.tcl file instead of in the MVRC Reference Methodology
   scripts.

   This allows you to start the MVRC tool with only the dc_setup.tcl file.

*  The mw_site_name_mapping variable setting syntax has been modified for
   consistency with IC Compiler.

   The list of value pairs now uses braces ({}). Design Compiler started supporting
   the use of braces for this variable in version E-2010.12-SP1. Because IC Compiler
   requires braces for this variable, it is recommended that you use braces in both
   tools.

*  The set_min_library command is not run by default for a multicorner-multimode
   flow.

   You can set the min_library variable for each scenario in
   ${DCRM_SCENARIOS_SETUP_FILE}, or you can uncomment the set_min_library command
   in dc_setup.tcl to apply global settings for all scenarios.

*  The check_library command is now performed with UPF and multicorner-multimode
   consistency checks in scripts that are generated for these flows. The output
   from check_library is now written out to the ${DCRM_CHECK_LIBRARY_REPORT} file.

   You can also use this modification in previous releases.

*  For a multicorner-multimode flow, set_tlu_plus_files is not performed in
   dc_setup.tcl.

   You should set TLUPlus files for each scenario in ${DCRM_SCENARIOS_SETUP_FILE}.


Common Changes in dc(_top).tcl
------------------------------

*  The rm_dc_scripts/dc(_top).tcl file is now available for a multicorner-multimode
   flow.

   The scripts contain several differences for a multicorner-multimode flow.
   These differences are not documented here. Please examine the scripts for details.

*  For the Lynx-compatible version of the scripts, all exit commands have been
   replaced with sproc_script_stop commands.

   This is a resolution of a known problem.

   When the scripts run in the Lynx Design System, some processing must be performed
   before the scripts can exit the tool. You can also choose to remain in the tool
   shell instead of exiting the tool.


E-2010.12
=========

General Updates
---------------

*  The Design Compiler Reference Methodology now includes new MVRC Static
   Verification Reference Methodology scripts for static verification of
   multivoltage designs.

   These scripts are included only when you select TRUE for the UPF Flow option
   in RMgen. Note that IEEE 1801 is also known as Unified Power Format (UPF).

*  The example UPF file, dc.upf, has been updated in this release.

   This file is included only when you select TRUE for the UPF Flow option in RMgen.

*  A new setting, AUTOREAD, has been added for the RTL Source Format option
   in RMgen.

   Select this setting to configure the flow to read in the RTL files automatically
   from a specified list of files and directories in both Design Compiler and
   Formality.

   Note:
      The AUTOREAD setting is not supported by the MVRC Static Verification
      Reference Methodology scripts in this release.

*  The Leakage Power Optimization option in RMgen has been updated.

   This option controls whether the scripts perform leakage power optimization
   and whether this optimization is based on the leakage power of cells in the
   libraries or the number of low threshold voltage cells in the design.

   The names for these settings in RMgen have been changed from POWER_BASED to POWER
   and from COUNT_BASED to COUNT.

*  To improve debugging, "RM-Info" messages have been added throughout the scripts.

   These messages indicate when the tool is processing separate files.


Changes in dc_setup_filenames.tcl
---------------------------------

*  The value for DCRM_DCT_FLOORPLAN_OUTPUT_FILE has been modified from
   ${DESIGN_NAME}.fp to ${DESIGN_NAME}.initial.fp.

   This change addresses the problem in which the tool read in this file
   automatically on subsequent runs of the flow.


Changes in dc_setup.tcl
-----------------------

*  Because the newly added MVRC Static Verification Reference Methodology scripts
   read the dc_setup.tcl file, conditional checks have been added to protect
   sections of the dc_setup.tcl script that are not supported by the MVRC tool.

   These conditional checks are present only when the UPF Flow option is set to TRUE
   in RMgen.

*  The variable sh_new_variable_message has been added and set to FALSE to
   remove the new variable information messages from the end of the log files.

*  You can configure multicore optimization by setting a Lynx task environment
   variable, $TEV(num_cores), when using the Lynx-compatible reference methodology
   flow.

*  A comment has been added stating that ${RTL_SOURCE_FILES} can also contain
   directory entries in the list when RTL_SOURCE_FORMAT is set to AUTOREAD.

*  A new Search Path Setup section has been added to construct the required search
   path automatically depending on the flow you are using.

*  Information has been added about setting up test simulation libraries for
   use with DFT Compiler or DFTMAX.


Common Changes in dc(_top).tcl
------------------------------

*  Additional scripting has been added for Lynx Design System compatibility.

   Lynx Compatible Setup sections have been added to the beginning of the
   Lynx-compatible reference methodology flow scripts. These new sections set up
   the support for Lynx metrics generation and the support for flow configuration
   using Lynx task environment variables (TEV).

   Lynx metrics are generated while running the script by calling the
   following predefined tool command language (Tcl) procedures:

   o  sproc_script_start
   o  sproc_generate_metrics
   o  sproc_script_stop

*  New autoread support has been added for reading in RTL files.

   Design Compiler can automatically read in the RTL, given a list of
   directories and files, and then write out an autoread script that either
   Design Compiler or Formality can use to read in the RTL.

*  Comments have been modified to no longer recommend putting set_related_supply_net
   commands into the ${DCRM_MV_SET_VOLTAGE_INPUT_FILE}.

   Formality requires the set_related_supply_net commands to be present in the
   RTL UPF file in order to include them in the verification modeling.

*  Information has been updated about how to write out a floorplan from IC Compiler
   for use in Design Compiler.

*  Information has been added about reading in physical-only cells as a part of the
   floorplan by using the extract_physical_constraints -allow_physical_cells command.

*  Information has been added about how to write out a create_voltage_area command
   script by using write_floorplan.

*  The source command has been changed to read_floorplan for reading in the
   create_voltage_area file to support files generated by write_floorplan.

*  New check_design commands have been added to check and report design issues
   before running compile_ultra.

*  Information has been added about setting up test simulation libraries for
   use with DFT Compiler or DFTMAX.

*  A recommendation has been added to run change_names before DFT setup when using
   an internal pins flow.

*  A new DFT Pipelined Scan Data Configuration section has been added to the
   DFT setup.

   Pipelined scan data registers are commonly used with DFTMAX designs to
   reduce the delay between top-level scan-in and scan-out ports and the
   first and last elements of the scan chain.


Unique Changes in dc.tcl
------------------------

*  Information has been added in comments about obtaining floorplan files from
   IC Compiler for block-level synthesis in a hierarchical flow.

*  The recommendation has been removed to use the -compact none option and the
   -traverse_disabled_arcs option with the create_ilm command for block-level
   synthesis in a hierarchical multivoltage flow.

   Tool fixes have been implemented that allow the information to be correctly
   preserved in the ILM without the use of these options.


Common changes in fm(_top).tcl
------------------------------

*  Additional scripting has been added for Lynx Design System compatibility.

   Lynx Compatible Setup sections have been added at the beginning of each
   Lynx-compatible reference methodology flow script. These new sections set up
   support for Lynx metrics generation and support for flow configuration using
   Lynx task environment variables (TEV).

   The scripts generate the Lynx metrics by calling the following predefined
   Tcl procedures:

   o  sproc_script_start
   o  sproc_script_stop

*  New autoread support has been added for reading in RTL files.

   Design Compiler can read in the RTL automatically, given a list of
   directories and files, and then write out an autoread script that
   the Formality script uses to read in the files.

*  For Milkyway netlists, the library name used by Formality has been changed
   to WORK for flow consistency.


Unique Changes in fm_top.tcl
----------------------------

*  The top-level verification in a hierarchical flow now reads in the whole
   chip RTL design and whole chip netlist, and then creates black boxes from the
   hierarchical blocks for all hierarchical flows. Previously, this black box
   verification flow was only used for the multivoltage hierarchical flow.

   This change is required to get the correct hierarchical design port interface
   definitions in all cases for verification using Verilog netlists.


D-2010.03-SP1
=============

General Updates
---------------

*  A new option named Physical Guidance has been added to the RMgen interface on
   SolvNet.

   This option configures the flow to pass physical guidance information to
   IC Compiler. This information can improve area and timing correlation and
   place_opt runtime.

   When you enable this option in the Design Compiler Reference Methodology, you
   should also enable the Physical Guidance option in the IC Compiler Reference
   Methodology.

*  The Leakage Power Optimization option in the RMgen interface on SolvNet has
   been updated.

   This option controls whether leakage power optimization is performed and whether
   the optimization is based on the leakage power of cells in the libraries or the
   number of low threshold voltage cells in the design.


Common Changes in dc(_top).tcl
------------------------------

*  The set_clock_gating_style example for clock gating setup has been updated:

   set_clock_gating_style -posedge {integrated} -negedge {integrated} \
                          -control_point before ...

*  New support has been added for the multithreshold voltage constraint.

   Use this constraint to limit the number of low threshold voltage (Vt) cells
   in the design. This constraint is supported only in DC Ultra topographical mode.

*  Support has been added for the Consistency Checker utility.

   This utility checks for inconsistent settings between Design Compiler and
   IC Compiler that can contribute to correlation mismatches.

*  A new AutoFix configuration section has been added to the design for test (DFT)
   setup.

   o  The section includes a new dc.dft_autofix_config.tcl example file.

   o  A new DCRM_DFT_AUTOFIX_CONFIG_INPUT_FILE filename variable has been added.


Unique Changes in dc.tcl
------------------------

*  New support has been added for passing physical guidance information
   to IC Compiler.

   This information can improve area and timing correlation and place_opt runtime

*  The on-chip clocking configuration example file contents have been updated.

   In addition, the file name has been changed to dc.dft_occ_config.tcl.


D-2010.03
=========

Lynx Compatibility
------------------

This release introduces Lynx-compatible versions of the reference methodology
scripts, which you can select in RMgen on SolvNet.

For more information about the Lynx-compatible reference methodology scripts, see
SolvNet article number 029774 at https://solvnet.synopsys.com/retrieve/029774.html.


Directory Structure Changes
---------------------------

The reference methodology directory structure has been reorganized for all
versions of the product reference methodologies.

*  The setup files have been moved to a new directory named rm_setup.

*  The scripts directory has been renamed rm_<prod>_scripts, where <prod> is
   the product identifier: dc, icc, pt, or tmax.

These changes are the same for every product reference methodology and apply to
both the standard and Lynx-compatible versions of the reference methodology scripts.

The working directory structure depends on whether you are using a standard
reference methodology flow or a Lynx-compatible reference methodology flow.

Note:
   The hierarchical flow is not yet available for the Lynx-compatible version
   of the reference methodology scripts. If you select both the Lynx-compatible
   version of the scripts and a hierarchical flow, RMgen generates the
   Lynx-compatible scripts for a top-down flow.


General Updates
---------------

*  For ease of customization, the Design Compiler Reference Methodology now uses
   DCRM_* variables for all input, output, and report files.

   o  A new file, rm_setup/dc_setup_filenames.tcl, has been added to customize
      these variable settings.

   o  The default values are backwards compatible with older releases.

*  A new value, SCRIPT, has been added for the RTL Source Format option in RMgen.

   This option allows you to use custom scripts for reading the RTL source files
   in Design Compiler and Formality.


Changes in dc_setup.tcl
-----------------------

*  The ICC_ILM_HIER_DESIGNS variable is not included if you selected a
   multivoltage hierarchical flow in RMgen.

   IC Compiler interface logic model (ILM) blocks are not supported in a
   multivoltage hierarchical flow.

*  The IC Compiler ILM link library setup is omitted for a multivoltage
   hierarchical flow


Common Changes in dc(_top).tcl
------------------------------

*  The auto_insert_level_shifters_on_clocks setting has been added for the
   multivoltage flow.

*  Support has been added for using an RTL read script in both Design Compiler and
   Formality.

*  The set_voltage script is no longer forced as a required input.

   o  The set_voltage commands could be applied as a part of the Synopsys Design
      Constraints (SDC) version 1.8.

   o  The "check_mv_design -power" command has been added to ensure that
      set_voltage has been set on all supply nets.

   The script exits if any settings are missing.

*  The path groups section has been updated with a more efficient way of getting
   clock ports:

   'set ports_clock_root \
       [filter_collection [get_attribute [get_clocks] sources] object_class==port]'

   This change is also preferred for previous releases.

*  The compile_clock_gating_through_hierarchy variable for enabling hierarchical
   clock gating has been added to the clock gating setup.

   This variable is commented out by default.

*  A comment has been added to enable leakage power optimization only for
   multiple threshold voltage (Vt) libraries.

*  The set_power_prediction section has been updated to enable power prediction
   by using clock tree estimation.

   The default tool behavior for power prediction was changed to off by default in
   Design Compiler version D-2010.03.

*  The floorplan input section has been updated to take three types of physical
   constraints. The preferred options for use when generating these files from
   IC Compiler have also been added.

   o  Design Exchange Format (DEF) (extract_physical_constraints)
   o  Floorplan file (read_floorplan)
   o  Tool command language (Tcl) constraints (source with fuzzy matching controls)

*  The write_physical_constraints command has been replaced with the
   write_floorplan for saving the floorplan in topographical mode.

   The write_floorplan command replaced the write_physical_constraints command in
   Design Compiler version D-2010.03.

*  The recommendation to use the -area_high_effort_script option with the
   compile_ultra command has been removed. In addition, this command option is
   no longer used by the QoR Strategy option for generating the scripts in RMgen.

   The -area_high_effort_script option does not change the behavior of the
   compile_ultra command, which is tuned to provide good area optimization
   results.

*  For multivoltage flows with test, a recommendation has been added to apply the
   set_related_supply_net command on newly created test ports if you are using the
   set_related_supply_net command on input or output ports of the design.

*  The options for set_dft_signal and set_dft_connect were reordered for
   consistency.

*  Information about the -location option of the set_scan_compression_configuration
   command has been added to specify where to insert compressor and decompressor
   logic for DFTMAX adaptive scan compression.

*  Additional verbose reports have been added for the dft_drc and preview_dft
   commands. These reports are generated by default prior to scan insertion.

   You no longer need to rerun the flow to generate these reports for debugging.

*  The -timing_high_effort_script option has been added for incremental
   compile_ultra optimization after scan insertion if -timing_high_effort_script
   was used with the initial compile_ultra optimization.

   Support for the -timing_high_effort_script option with incremental compile_ultra
   optimization is new in Design Compiler version D-2010.03.

*  The SDC output has been changed to use version 1.8 as the default.

   o  This version adds set_voltage commands to the SDC output for a multivoltage
      flow.

   o  Older releases should still use "write_sdc -version 1.7" to avoid problems.

*  A script has been added to capture an image of the congestion map in the layout
   window from a batch script run in topographical mode.


Unique Changes in dc.tcl
------------------------

*  To verify the correct preservation of interface timing information for the
   hierarchical flow, the compare_interface_timing flow has been added to
   create_ilm.


Unique Changes in dc_top.tcl
----------------------------

*  The -master_instance option has been added to set_physical_hierarchy to handle
   multiple instances.

   Beginning with version D-2010.03, errors occur if set_physical_hierarchy is
   applied to more than one instance of the same design.

*  The section used to write out the top-level design in the hierarchical flow
   has been updated.

   Beginning with version D-2010.03, IC Compiler ILMs, Design Compiler ILMs, and
   DC Ultra topographical mode Synopsys logical database format (.ddc) hierarchical
   designs are skipped automatically by the write command.


Changes in fm.tcl
-----------------

*  The signature_analysis_allow_subset_match variable has been added to the list
   of variables for the Formality automatic setup configuration.

*  Information has been updated for verification_set_undriven_signals, which is
   now set to a value of synthesis in the Formality automatic setup configuration.

*  Support has been added for using an RTL read script in both Design Compiler and
   Formality.

*  A upf_use_additional_db_attributes variable setting for the multivoltage flow
   has been added to ensure that Formality does not apply retention settings to
   instantiated integrated clock gating (ICG) cells.

   This behavior is consistent with Design Compiler behavior.

*  A new report_setup_status section has been added to report design statistics,
   design read warning messages, and user-specified setup information prior to
   matching.

   This section is optional and is commented out by default.

*  The analyze_points command has been added for unsuccessful verifications.


C-2009.06-SP1
=============

*  Added the following additional options to the adaptive scan compression
   configuration:

   o  High X-tolerant adaptive scan compression
   o  Low power gating with adaptive scan compression

*  Added the on-chip clocking configuration section to the design for test (DFT)
   setup

   o  Included new dc.occ_config.tcl example file when on-chip clocking
      configuration flow is chosen


dc_setup.tcl changes: none
--------------------

dc_scripts/dc(_top).tcl common changes:
---------------------------------------

*  Removed the recommendation to use -site_row with write_physical_constraints
   or report_physical_constraints

   This is now the default behavior in the C-2009.06-SP1 release.

   Added information about using -no_site_row instead to skip writing out the site
   rows in the physical constraint output files.

*  Added high X-tolerant adaptive scan compression options

*  Added on-chip clocking configuration section to DFT setup
   o  Included new dc.occ_config.tcl example file
   o  Added additional dft_drc command for all bypass mode to DFT output reports

*  Reorganized DFT output file section to avoid redundant code
   o  Only the adaptive scan compression section is commented or uncommented


C-2009.06
=========

*  Changed "set" to "set_app_var" when setting application variables in all scripts.

   o  This is recommended to flag cases where variable names might be misspelled.
   o  This is also recommended for all older releases.

common_setup.tcl changes: none

dc_setup.tcl changes:
---------------------

*  Added multicore optimization setup using the "set_host_options" command.

dc_scripts/dc(_top).tcl common changes:
---------------------------------------

*  Updated comments regarding use of the -site_row and -pre_route options for
   physical constraints.

*  Updated comments to indicate that the -num_cpus option should no longer be
   used to enable multicore optimization with compile_ultra.

*  Set write_sdc to write out version 1.7 for backwards compatibility.

   o  SDC has been updated to version 1.8, which is default in C-2009.06.
   o  SDC version 1.8 adds "set_voltage" settings to the SDC file.
   o  You should continue to use the ${DESIGN_NAME}.set_voltage.tcl file for the
      multivoltage flow until the flow is fully qualified with SDC version 1.8.

dc_scripts/dc_top.tcl unique changes:
-------------------------------------

*  Removed read_test_model for IC Compiler ILMs when DFT flow is not selected
   (bug fix)

fm.tcl changes:
---------------

*  Added the -no_pg option to the "read_milkyway" command for reading Milkyway
   designs from Design Compiler to prevent automatic linking to power-aware
   versions of the cells.

   o  This is needed for new "read_milkyway" behavior in C-2009.06 Formality version


B-2008.09-SP4
=============

*  The IEEE 1801 multivoltage hierarchical flow has been added to the
   Design Compiler Reference Methodology in this release. IEEE 1801 is also known
   as Unified Power Format (UPF).

common_setup.tcl changes:
-------------------------

*  Added the following common hierarchical flow variables for tools to share
   information about hierarchical block names:

   o  HIERARCHICAL_DESIGNS
   o  HIERARCHICAL_CELLS

*  Added the LIBRARY_DONT_USE_FILE variable for tools to share the library
   dont_use modification script.

dc_setup.tcl changes:
---------------------

*  For the UPF hierarchical flow, the search path is updated automatically
   with the path to ${RESULTS}.  This allows Formality to find the output
   UPF files.

*  The dont_use file is now specified by LIBRARY_DONT_USE_FILE in the
   common_setup.tcl file.  This file will automatically be read in if it
   exists.

dc_scripts/dc(_top).tcl common changes:
---------------------------------------

*  The operating conditions example in the script is now commented out.

   Remember to define the operating conditions correctly for your design.

*  The create_voltage_area command settings are now sourced from a design
   setup script if it exists: ${DESIGN_NAME}.create_voltage_area.tcl.

   This makes it easier to manage multiple setups for multiple blocks in a
   hierarchical flow.

*  The extract_physical_constraints command is now wrapped to check for the
   existence of the DEF file or else continue otherwise.

   Although the DEF file is highly recommended, it is not an absolute requirement.

*  The compile_ultra -check_only command information has been updated to
   recommend using the same options that are used for the subsequent
   compile_ultra command.

*  DFT signal type definitions are now sourced from a file:
   ${DESIGN_NAME}.dft_signal_defs.tcl

   o  Example settings are now commented out.
   o  This makes it easier to manage multiple setups for multiple blocks
      in a hierarchical flow.

*  The following command is now commented out in all flows:

   set_dft_drc_configuration -clock_gating_init_cycles 1

   The comments have been enhanced to explain when this
   should be used.

   This change can be applied to previous releases as well

*  The -capture_procedure multi_clock option has been removed from
   the create_test_protocol command.

   This is the default behavior since the B-2008.09-SP2 release.

*  An extra check_mv_design command has been added, without the -verbose
   option, to provide a quick summary report.

   The additional -verbose report option is still available for more
   detailed review.

dc_scripts/dc_top.tcl unique changes:
-------------------------------------

*  The dc_scripts/dc_top.tcl file is now available for the UPF hierarchical
   flow. There are several differences between the non-multivoltage and the
   multivoltage version of this script.  These will not be documented here.

*  The new ${HIERARCHICAL_DESIGNS} variable, defined in common_setup.tcl,
   is now used in the script.  Make sure that this variable is added to
   your common_setup.tcl file.

dc_scripts/fm.tcl changes:
--------------------------

*  Milkyway support information updated in the comments.

dc_scripts/fm_top.tcl changes:
------------------------------

*  The dc_scripts/fm_top.tcl file is now available for the UPF hierarchical
   flow. There are several differences between the nonmultivoltage and
   multivoltage versions of this script.  These differences are not
   documented here.  Please examine the scripts for details.


B-2008.09-SP1
=============

*  This is the first release that allows you to customize the reference
   methodology scripts by using flow settings from the SolvNet GUI interface.

*  The dc_MV.tcl and fm_MV.tcl files are no longer included as separate files.
   If the multivoltage flow is selected in the reference methodology
   generation options, dc.tcl and fm.tcl are contained in the multivoltage flow.

*  The dc_MV.upf file has been renamed to dc.upf and is included only for
   multivoltage flows.

*  The dc_top.tcl and fm_top.tcl files are not included unless a hierarchical
   flow without multivoltage is selected in the reference methodology
   generation options.

*  A pointer to SolvNet has been added for more information about UPFgen,
   a Tcl utility for quickly generating a UPF template file.

common_setup.tcl changes:
-------------------------
No changes.

dc_setup.tcl changes:
---------------------

*  ICC_ILM_DESIGNS comment changed.  The same set of scripts will be usable

      capabilities.

*  Added the multicore optimization option to compile_ultra -num_cpus, with
   a pointer to supporting usage documentation.

*  Modified the DFT for Clock Gating section to document the new insert_dft
   command-based test port hookup flow.

*  Added the -physical option to the report_area command for Design Compiler
   topographical mode.


B-2008.09
=========

*  The following new Formality reference methodology scripts have been added:

   o  dc_scripts/fm_MV.tcl (top-down multivoltage Formality script with UPF)
   o  dc_scripts/fm_top.tcl (top-level Formality script for dc_top.tcl)

*  Setup scripts are now sourced verbosely before the file header comment
   block to improve logging of script flow.

common_setup.tcl changes:
-------------------------

*  Added the MW_REFERENCE_CONTROL_FILE variable definition.

   o  The IC Compiler Reference Methodology assumes that this variable is
      defined and that the tool can use it.
   o  The Design Compiler Reference Methodology does not make use of this
      setting.

dc_setup.tcl changes:
---------------------

*  ICC_ILM_HIER_DESIGNS is commented out temporarily for the hierarchical flow
   in version B-2008.09:

   #############################################################################
   # Note: IC Compiler ILM support is temporarily unavailable in the B-2008.09
   # release due to Milkyway compatibility issues.  There is a plan to fix this
   # in a later service pack release.
   #############################################################################

*  Added set_mw_lib_reference to the Milkyway library setup.

   This resolves cases where Milkyway reference library changes
   result in a Milkyway design library mismatch.

dc_scripts/dc(_MV)(_top).tcl common changes:
--------------------------------------------

*  Removed "set_max_area 0" from the scripts.

   This is the default behavior now for full and incremental compile_ultra.

*  Removed the "set_max_total_power" power optimization constraint.

   o  No longer recommended to use this constraint.
   o  You can now use all combinations of the set_max_leakage_power
      and set_max_dynamic_power commands.

*  Removed comment that power prediction does not support ILMs.

   ILMs are now supported with power prediction enabled.

*  Added clarification that DFT signal definitions define TestMode signals only for
   hookup_testports.

   o  Remaining TestMode signals should be defined after hookup_testports.
   o  Added separate TestMode signal definition for ADAPTIVE SCAN.
   o  Recommended also for previous releases.

*  Note added that hookup_testports functionality has been integrated
   into insert_dft.

*  Revised the DFT clock-mixing specification to clarify differences between block
   and top-level settings in a hierarchical flow.

*  Added the -capture_procedure multi_clock option to create_test_protocol command.

   This option is recommended for the ATPG flow.

*  Added the "-names verilog" option to the write_test_protocol command for regular
   scan mode.

   o  Missing in previous reference methodology releases.
   o  Also recommended for previous releases.

*  Added the set_svf -off command, which is recommended for closing and
   writing automated setup (.svf) file.

   Closes the .svf file and makes it available earlier in the flow.

*  Uncommented the report_congestion command by default in the reporting section.

   This command requires a license for Design Compiler Graphical.

dc_scripts/dc(_MV).tcl common changes:
--------------------------------------

*  Reorganized the output and reporting sections.

   o  Output design data early to snapshot and allow parallel analysis.
   o  Design data is still saved if reporting fails.

*  Moved the write_milkyway command to the bottom of the script.

   o  Also added a comment about not using write_milkyway when creating
      a Design Compiler ILM.
   o  Can be done also in previous releases.

dc_scripts/dc_top.tcl unique changes:
-------------------------------------

*  Added section to prevent upwards boundary optimization from physical blocks.

   o  Requirement for hierarchical Formality verification flow.
   o  Recommended also for previous releases.

*  Added specification of DFT MAX integration strategy, which is
   recommended also for previous releases.

*  Removed the enable_ao_synthesis variable setting.

   o  Now enabled by default.
   o  Fully supported by the multivoltage flow (no reason to disable).

*  Enhanced the multivoltage reporting section.

   o  Added the following reports:

      report_power_switch
      report_level_shifter
      report_isolation_cell
      report_retention_cell

   o  Redirected the multivoltage reports to the report directory.

dc_scripts/fm.tcl changes:
--------------------------

*  Added the following note:

   Due to Milkyway schema changes in the B-2008.09 release for both Design Compiler and IC Compiler, Formality versions earlier than B-2008.12 do not support reading
   the Milkyway design from Design Compiler version B-2008.09.

   o  Recommended that you not use Milkyway design input until version B-2008.12.
   o  Note that Milkyway design input is not supported for the UPF flow (fm_MV.tcl).

*  Removed case conversion for Milkyway design name.

   Issue is fixed in the version B-2008.09 Formality release.


A-2007.12-SP2
=============

*  Reference Methodology MV/MS reference script has been migrated to a UPF flow:

   o  dc_scripts/dc_MV.tcl (top-down multivoltage synthesis script)
   o  dc_scripts/dc_MV.upf (example UPF file)

   Note:
       The multivoltage hierarchical flow is not yet available.
       The dc_scripts/dc_MV.tcl script is for top-down use only.

common_setup.tcl changes:
-------------------------

*  Added DESIGN_REF_DATA_PATH to be used as a prefix for absolute paths in the
   common_setup.tcl file variable settings.

   Absolute paths are required for the hierarchical reference methodology flow.

*  Added additional power domain definition example.

   Note:
       Actual number of power domains is design specific.

dc_setup.tcl changes:
---------------------
No changes.

dc_scripts/dc(_MV)(_top).tcl common changes:
--------------------------------------------

*  Added section to apply top-level operating conditions (required for MV flow).

*  Added -congestion as a new compile_ultra option.

*  Redirected hookup_testports command output to a separate log file.

   o  Syntax was incorrect
   o  The saif_map database must be kept on for read_saif
      (before report_power) to work.

dc_scripts/dc_top.tcl unique changes:
-------------------------------------

*  Made changes to avoid design renaming/linking conflicts for hierarchical blocks

   o  RTL versions of the hierarchical designs are now removed prior to saving
      an elaborated design.
   o  The link command is removed after reading elaborated design to avoid Presto
      rebuilding the RTL version.
   o  The list_designs -show_file command is added to verify that the correct design
      versions have been linked.

*  Reorganized design data output section reorganized for consistency.

dc_scripts/dc_MV.tcl unique changes:
------------------------------------

*  Note that the new dc_MV.tcl script must be run with Design Compiler in UPF mode
   (-upf_mode option to dc_shell).

*  Added a check to exit if not in UPF mode.

*  The enable_ao_synthesis command is now enabled by default in the script.

*  The {DESIGN_NAME}.upf UPF file is used for design MV setup.

   o  Design specific sections have been removed from the main script.
   o  Script will exit if necessary UPF loading is not successful.
   o  Final UPF is saved as a part of the design data output.

*  The ${DESIGN_NAME}.set_voltage.tcl file is read for the design-specific
   set_voltage commands.

   o  set_voltage is not covered by UPF or SDC.
   o  Use this setup file also in IC Compiler.

*  Added information about multivoltage-specific set_scan_configuration options.

*  New multivoltage script has single multivoltage violation check after synthesis
   is completed.

dc_setup.tcl changes:
---------------------

*  Added hierarchical flow design variables:

   o  DDC_HIER_DESIGNS:     List of Design Compiler hierarchical design names
   o  DC_ILM_HIER_DESIGNS:  List of Design Compiler ILM hierarchical design names
   o  ICC_ILM_HIER_DESIGNS: List of IC Compiler ILM hierarchical design names

*  Added the Milkyway check_library command to verify Milkyway library setup.

*  Added section to include IC Compiler ILMs in link library.

   Using IC Compiler ILMs requires Milkyway library setup.

dc_scripts/dc(_MV).tcl common changes:
--------------------------------------

*  Migrated the clock-gating flow to use compile_ultra -gate_clock.

   o  Removed insert_clock_gating.
   o  Removed propagate_constraints -gate_clock.
   o  Added -gate_clock to default compile_ultra options.
   o  Moved report_clock_gating to final reports section.

*  Commented out power prediction is by default.

   o  Power prediction in topographical mode is enabled automatically when using
      power constraints.
   o  You can explicitly enable power prediction with by using the
      set_power_prediction true variable.
   o  Power prediction can not be enabled when using IC Compiler ILMs.

*  Reorganized the DFT output section.

   o  "write_scan_def" must be run before writing binary design files
   o  Binary SCANDEF is now stored in .ddc files
   o  "check_scan_def" added to verify SCANDEF integrity

dc_scripts/dc.tcl unique changes:
---------------------------------

*  Added read_sdc to read budgeted constraints for hierarchical flow (commented out).

*  Added forced design uniquification with design name prefix for hierarchical flow.

   This prevents possible name collisions when integrating hierarchical designs at the top-level.

*  Added optional ILM creation step at the end of the hierarchical flow.

   Note:
       These new sections are specific for the hierarchical flow and are commented out
       by default. Uncomment them if using this as a block-level script in a
       hierarchical flow.


A-2007.12
=========

*  The Design Compiler Reference Methodology now includes a Formality reference
   script: dc_scripts/fm.tcl.

common_setup.tcl changes:
-------------------------

*  Added the MIN_ROUTING_LAYER and MAX_ROUTING_LAYER variables for
   the set_ignored_layers command in Design Compiler and IC Compiler.

   Design Compiler now supports the same syntax as IC Compiler for set_ignored_layers.

*  Removed the VA and VA_CELLS variables from the multivoltage Common
   Variables section.

   The voltage area name and cells are now derived from the PD definitions
   and must match.

dc_setup.tcl changes:
---------------------

*  The script has been reorganized to allow shared setup by
   Design Compiler and Formality:

   o  Automatic conditional checks added for dc_shell.
   o  Milkyway setup variables moved up to common section for all tools.

*  The DCT_IGNORED_ROUTING_LAYERS variable has been removed:

   o  The syntax of set_ignored_layers has changed to match IC Compiler
      version A-2007.12.
   o  Replaced by MIN_ROUTING_LAYER and MAX_ROUTING_LAYER in the
      common_setup.tcl file.

dc_scripts/dc(_MV).tcl common changes:
-------------------------------------

*  Design Read

   o  Save elaborated design after read for use in same release (could
      also be done in previous releases).

*  Design Constraints

   Added option to enable multiple clocks per register (MCPR) consideration in optimization and timing analysis:

   o  This can also be used in previous releases as needed.
   o  Requires that all clock domain exceptions be specified to avoid
      unnecessary runtime.

*  Physical Constraints

   The set_ignored_layers command now uses the -min_routing_layer
   and -max_routing_layer options the same way IC Compiler uses them.

*  Compile

   Added the compile_ultra -check_only option to verify library
   and design setup prior to running topographical mode synthesis.

*  Output Files

   Added the write_parasitics command for topographical mode synthesis. This can also be used in previous releases.

dc_scripts/dc_MV.tcl only changes:
---------------------------------

*  The create_voltage_area command now uses the -power_domain option to link voltage
   areas to power domain definitions.

   The -name option and cell_list names should no longer be used in A-2007.12 due to possible definition conflicts.

*  Additional level_shifter check and optional insertion added after insert_dft
   (needed for some libraries).


Z-2007.03-SP1
=============

*  The Reference Methodology now includes a multivoltage/multiscenario
   reference script: dc_scripts/dc_MV.tcl

common_setup.tcl changes:
------------------------

*  Added new section to define common multivoltage variables used by
   both Design Compiler and IC Compiler.

dc_setup.tcl changes:
---------------------

*  Added conditional check for pre-existence of $mw_design_library
   before executing create_mw_lib.


Z-2007.03
=========

*  First new version of Design Compiler Reference Methodology for
   the Z-2007.03 release.

dc_setup.tcl changes:
--------------------
*  Added DCT_IGNORED_ROUTING_LAYERS.

   Using the same ignored layers that is used for placement and routing
   improves correlation.

*  Changed Milkyway library setup to use create_mw_lib and open_mw_lib
   instead of create_mw_design.

   The new Milkyway UI is consistent with IC Compiler.

*  Added check_tlu_plus_files.

   This command is supported in Design Compiler version Z-2007.03
   for the TLU+ consistency check.

dc_scripts/dc.tcl changes:
--------------------------
*  Made changes for the new Switching Activity Interchange Format (SAIF) name
   mapping flow, which changes your SAIF flow in version Z-2007.03):

   o  Removed power_preserve_rtl_hier_names; replaced by a new flow.
   o  Added the following commands for PrimeTime PX:

      saif_map -start
      read_saif -auto_map_names
      saif_map -stop
      saif_map -write_map

*  The default clock gating style is now recommended for most cases.

   The set_clock_gating_style command is now commented out.

*  Added set_ignored_layers, which uses the DCT_IGNORED_ROUTING_LAYERS
   defined in dc_setup.tcl.

   Using the same ignored layers that are used in placement and routing improves correlation.

*  Physical constraints:

   o  The extract_physical_constraints command no longer needs scripted name
      translation in version Z-2007.03.
   o  The set_fuzzy_query_options command has been added for
      extract_physical_constraints automatic name matching.

*  Compile:

   Added the new -retime option for adaptive retiming to the list of recommended
   compile_ultra options.

*  DFT Setup:

   o  Added a section explaining how to handle new test ports created
      in a Design Compiler session.

   o  DFT setup for clock gating has been changed in version Z-2007.03:

      Removed:

      -- test_dft_drc_ungate_clocks
      -- test_dft_drc_ungate_internal_clocks test_setup_additional_clock_pulse

      Added:

      -- set_dft_drc_configuration -clock_gating_init_cycles

   o  The following setting is no longer conditional:

      set_dft_insertion_configuration -synthesis_optimization none

      This is now the setting that you should always use to be consistent in all
      Design Compiler modes.

*  DFT incremental compile now always runs the following command:

   compile_ultra -incremental -scan

   Design Compiler supports the compile_ultra -incremental command in
   version Z-2007.03.

*  SDC output cleanup avoids writing RC information by setting the
