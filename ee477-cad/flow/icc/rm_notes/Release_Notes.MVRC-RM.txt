G-2012.06 and G-2012.06-SP4
===========================

These releases of the MVRC Static Verification Reference Methodology do not include 
any product-specific changes. However, they do provide support for the enhancements 
in the Lynx-compatible reference methodology flow. For information about these 
enhancements, see the file named Release_Notes.LynxCompatible-RM.txt.


F-2011.09-SP2 and F-2011.09-SP4
===============================

These releases of the MVRC Static Verification Reference Methodology do not include 
any product-specific changes. However, they do provide support for the enhancements 
in the Lynx-compatible reference methodology flow. 

For the Design Compiler Reference Methodology, which did not participate in the 
F-2011.09-SP2 reference methodology release, the Lynx-compatible reference 
methodology enhancements take affect in the F-2011.09-SP4 release.

For information about the Lynx-compatible reference methodology enhancements, 
see the file named Release_Notes.LynxCompatible-RM.txt.


F-2011.09
=========

General Updates
---------------

The sh_continue_on_error variable is now set to true to match the behavior 
of other Synopsys tools.


Changes in mvrc(_top).tcl for the Design Compiler Reference Methodology
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

*  The MVRC_RTL_READ_SCRIPT variable is now defined in both the standard and 
   Lynx-compatible reference methodology flows to resolve a problem in previous 
   releases.

*  The script has been updated to use MVRC_RTL_READ_SCRIPT when you select the 
   AUTOREAD setting for the RTL Source Format option in RMgen. 
   
   This variable is necessary because Design Compiler does not write an RTL read 
   script for MVRC. Previous releases used the MVRC_RTL_AUTOREAD_SCRIPT variable 
   when you selected the AUTOREAD setting. 


Lynx Compatibility 
-------------------

This release provides enhancements in the Lynx-compatible reference 
methodology flow. For information about these enhancements, see the 
file named Release_Notes.LynxCompatible-RM.txt.


E-2010.12-SP4
=============

This release of the MVRC Static Verification Reference Methodology provides 
enhancements in the Lynx-Compatible reference methodology flow. For information 
about these enhancements, see the file named Release_Notes.LynxCompatible-RM.txt.


E-2010.12-SP2
=============

General Updates
---------------

*  The MVRC Static Verification Reference Methodology scripts have been enhanced to 
   support tool enhancements in MVRC version E-2011.03.

*  A new capability has been added to run MVRC on PG netlists from top-down or 
   block-level place and route output in the IC Compiler Reference Methodology. 


Changes in mvrc(_top).tcl for the Design Compiler Reference Methodology
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

*  The alias procedure to support the source -echo -verbose command has been removed.

*  The synopsys_program_name string setting "mvrc_shell" is no longer needed.
   
   The synopsys_program_name string is now set to "mvrc" in the tool.

*  Tool command language (Tcl) glob commands are now used in the search_searchpath 
   routine instead of the exec commands.

*  The search_path and link_library variable settings have been removed. 

   MVRC now uses the search_path and link_library variable settings from 
   dc_setup.tcl.

*  The read_verilog and read_power_intent commands now look for IEEE 1801 and HDL 
   files in the directories specified by the search_path variable.
   
   IEEE 1801 is also known as Unified Power Format (UPF).
   
   Usage of the search_searchpath routine for this purpose has been removed.


E-2010.12
=========

This release of the MVRC Static Verification Reference Methodology provides the 
capabilities to run MVRC on netlist output or RTL in a top-down or block-level 
synthesis flow and to run MVRC on a full chip design in a bottom-up hierarchical 
synthesis flow.
